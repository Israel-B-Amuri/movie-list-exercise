I have created a movie list with the help of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. While working on this project, I was able to deepen my understanding of working with backend. I used express to create server routes and then fetched the data from frontend. The followings are the things that I learned while working on this project. 
# How to filter arrays 
# How to create routes and fetch data from them. 

#####

This project can further be improved by:
# Making it possible to change themes
# Making it possible to not just display a list of movies and details about them,
but to enable users to watch the movies.
